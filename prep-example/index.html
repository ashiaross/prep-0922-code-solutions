    <!-- write your app ideas here ðŸ‘‡ -->
    The application ideas I have would greatly help me in my workflow as a legal
    secretary. Having applications such as a program that can convert a set of
    individual HTML pages to PDF files all at once would be great. Adobe Acrobat
    has something like this, but I could never get it to function the way I
    needed it to. I'd also like to make an improved version of an application
    called ProLaw. It is a required program my firm uses, however, it is quite
    inefficient in its setup. There are many changes that could be made to give
    the user's a better experience in addition to having a better ui. Basically,
    applications I want to build are ones that will help others within their
    daily work tasks especially for tedious/time consuming tasks.
